#  Heuristic Search and Games

This code was written for the course Elements of Artificial Intelligence (CSCI-B 551) at Indiana University handled by Professor David Crandall. Skeleton code was provided by the Professor to get us started with the assignment.


**What does the program do?** <br/>
* The program has implementation of Artificial Intelligent player for two different games - Rameses and Totogram.
* More details about the game can be found from this [link](https://github.com/manikandan5/Heuristic-search-and-Games/blob/master/Question.pdf).

**How does it find it?** <br/>

* The program uses various heuristic search algorithms to find the best possible move for the game.
* It considers time factor into account and arrives at an optimal solution.

Detailed explanation about how the code works and the reason why we chose this implementation could be found [here](https://github.com/manikandan5/Heuristic-search-and-Games/blob/master/Totogram.pdf).
